                        li The first rule is that #[code (a b c ...)] is a function call, #[code a] is the function with #[code b c ...] being the arguments.
                        li
                            | The second rule is the #[em.text-bold only] exception to the first rule: when declaring functions like #[code (fun (arg1 arg2 ...) body)],
                            | the definition of the argument block #[em.text-bold isn't] considered as a function call.
                    p To sum it up: everything is a function call, except the definition of the arguments block of a function.
